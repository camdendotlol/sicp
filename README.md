# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from Abelson et al.'s [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf).

I'm using Racket with the `sicp` language enabled because the original MIT Scheme doesn't compile on a modern Mac.

Each file will correspond to a chapter and solutions will be accompanied by test cases where appropriate. Where possible, test cases use a (= computation expected-result) format that will produce "#t" in the Racket console if they pass.
