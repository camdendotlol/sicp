; 1.4
; The expression is evaluated with either + or - depending
; on the result of the (> b 0) comparison.

; 1.5
; Applicative order goes into an infinite loop because the interpreter
; tries to evaluate (p) before running the (test) function.
; Normal order will return 0 because it does not need to evaluate (p)
; to resolve the if statement.

; 1.6
; The (sqrt-iter) function will call itself recursively forever
; because it will evaluate both sides of the (cond) statement.
; A normal (if) clause will only evaluate the righthand side if
; the lefthand side is false.

; The first procedure is recursive because it increments the result of its
; recursive call. The second procedure is iterative because it simply
; returns the result of calling itself, allowing the Scheme interpreter
; to optimize the procedure into an iterative process.
