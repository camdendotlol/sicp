; Applicative order goes into an infinite loop because the interpreter
; tries to evaluate (p) before running the (test) function.
; Normal order will return 0 because it does not need to evaluate (p)

; This seems to take 2x longer instead of 0.5x as the book says?

; Actually, running it repeatedly with and without `next`, it

; and then speed up a lot. After they've been sped up, the `next`
; version does seem to be a little under twice as fast, but not

; This even includes gigantic numbers like 1000000000000000000000000.

; a lot faster.

; As with the previous excercise, the runtime numbers are below 0
